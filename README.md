# Pedagogical experiments

This repository contains experiments: they implement a few subjects, techniques, patterns,
only in a training context.\
So, examples are simple but always (I hope so) with an interesting pedagogical point of view.\
Have fun!

*Nb. See the Makefile: each example has its own rules.*
